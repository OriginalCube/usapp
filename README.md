# Dev notes
There are a lot of things that can be improved with this site. A good first experience of using web socketing to interact with users, it gave me an idea of how much can features can I add to my next project. 

# Built with  <br/>
React JS (vite) for front-end designs. <br/>
Express JS for back-end scripts.  <br/>
Mongo DB for database storage of accounts.  <br/>
Socket.IO which allows web sockets for real-time response with users.  <br/>
